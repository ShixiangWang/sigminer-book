<p><a href="https://github.com/ShixiangWang/sigflow"><strong>Sigflow</strong></a> provides useful mutational signature analysis workflows based on R package <strong>sigminer</strong>. It can auto-extract mutational signatures, fit mutation data to COSMIC reference signatures (SBS/DBS/INDEL) and run bootstrapping analysis for signature fitting.</p>
<p>For full documentation, please read Sigflow <a href="https://github.com/ShixiangWang/sigflow"><em>README</em></a>.</p>

<p>Signature fitting analysis may befit from directly specifying known signatures identified in a cancer type. We collect such information and provide the following data tables.</p>
